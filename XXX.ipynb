We need some historical data for our backtest. For this example we will use data/TSLA.csv.

tsla_ohlc = pd.read_csv("data/TSLA.csv", index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
# Convert the timestamp column to datetime format
tsla_ohlc["timestamp"] = pd.to_datetime(tsla_ohlc["timestamp"])
# Set timestamp as index
tsla_ohlc.set_index("timestamp", inplace=True)

display(tsla_ohlc.head())

A simple Moving Average Crossover Strategy
We construct a simple trend-following system based on two Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) of the closing price 
, each with a different window length 
.

The Simple Moving Average at time 
 with window 
 is defined as:
 

In our strategy:

The fast (short) moving average uses a smaller window 
 (e.g., 
).
The slow (long) moving average uses a larger window 
 (e.g., 
).
Typically, we have 
.

# Compute two simple moving averages: fast (20-day) and slow (50-day)
ma_fast = tsla_ohlc['close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
ma_slow = tsla_ohlc['close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# Just some plotting to visualize the idea
fig_ma = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(tsla_ohlc['close'], label='Close')
plt.plot(ma_fast, label=f'Fast SMA')
plt.plot(ma_slow, label=f'Slow SMA')
plt.legend()
plt.close()
display(fig_ma)

Entry and Exit Signals
We generate discrete "buy" and "sell" signals by detecting crossovers of the two SMAs:

Entry signal (go long) at time 
 when the fast SMA crosses above the slow SMA:
 

Exit signal (close position) at time 
 when the fast SMA crosses below the slow SMA:
 

# Entry when fast MA crosses above slow MA:
entries = (ma_fast > ma_slow) & (ma_fast.shift(1) <= ma_slow.shift(1))
#  Exit when fast MA crosses below slow MA:
exits = (ma_fast < ma_slow) & (ma_fast.shift(1) >= ma_slow.shift(1))
Backtest Mechanics
This is a very simple backtest using the following parameters:

Initial capital: 
Position sizing: Fully invest all available capital at each entry; liquidate the entire position at each exit
Transaction costs: A round-trip transaction fee of 
 is applied per completed trade (entry and exit)
Performance metrics: After running the backtest we can assess the strategy using vectorbt's risk and return metrics
Please note that this is just a simplified example. A very important component of a serious strategy is position sizing -- typically one would not invest all available capital into one asset. Speaking of, vectorbt is well capable to backtest strategies using multiple assets.

A comment on trade execution
The biggest enemy of all backtests is look-ahead bias. That is, you must never execute a trade based on information that became available after the time you are trading. The backtest above is not ideal, because we create signals and trade on the same information at time 
. So, the signal based on 
 is executed and evaluated on 
.

As a solution, we could execute the signal based on 
 at 
; this can be achieved by calling .shift(1) on all signals. Please note that for our daily data there is a 24-hour gap between signal generation and trade execution; this is conservative but not very realistic. Especially in shorter time intervals, it can be ideal to produce signals on 
 but trade and evaluate on 
.

Alternatively, especially for low-frequency data, one could assume that the signal is generated at a price very close to 
, while accounting for slippage.
 

In real or paper trading, one would store both the 
 as well as 
 and measure slippage continuously. This is particularly important for strategies trading large amounts, because market impact of the trade itself might create slippage. By the way, you could also explicitly provide the trade price as price=....

In the following example we assume slippage of 2 basis points (0.02%), the true value depends heavily on the market and can ultimately only be assessed though actual trading.

# Backtest
pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(
    tsla_ohlc['close'], 
    entries,
    exits,
    fees=0.001,
    slippage=0.0002, # 0.02% slippage on every fill
    init_cash=100000,
    freq='1D'
)

# Compare this to the performance of the original backtest
